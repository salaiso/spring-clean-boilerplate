# Spring-jpa-boilerplate

This is a simple (minimal) boilerplate project which spins up a couple HTTP endpoints for fast prototyping. Implemented in the style of 'uncle Bob's clean architecture' (https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) 

The most relevant features are:

 - JPA with entitymanagers and transactions
 - Flyway database migration
 - Session management
 - Authentication filtering
